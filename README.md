### Build best-of-breed solutions for fast-growing online businesses

The Bigcommerce Stores API features a RESTful architecture, allowing you to code in the language of your choice. All connections require authentication and are secured by TLS encryption. It supports the JSON media type and uses UTF-8 character encoding.

With clever use of this API, you can automate various commerce, business, and publishing tasks and integrate all kinds of apps with our platform.

### Let's get started!

### 1. Join the Technology Partner Program

Before you begin, you'll need a sandbox store. Bigcommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Technology Partner Program. To get your sandbox store, apply to become a Bigcommerce Technology Partner. To be approved as a partner, you will need:

* A website
* The ability to support users of your app
* A PayPal account: if you want to get paid for referring people to Bigcommerce (optional)

```
NOTE: The email address you use in this form must be the same as the email address that you use to log into your sandbox store and the same as the email address you use to log into [My Apps](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/my/apps).
```

Once approved, you will receive one or more emails containing:

* **Your Partner ID:** required to submit an app for App Store consideration
* **Temporary Partner Portal credentials:** change your password immediately after logging in

'''
NOTE: If you do not receive your Partner ID by email, contact (appstore@bigcommerce.com)[mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com].
